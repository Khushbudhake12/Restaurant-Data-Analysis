**Announcement**
I am excited to announce that I have successfully completed my project on restaurant data analysis at Cognifyz Technologies. This project has provided valuable insights into various aspects of the restaurant industry through comprehensive data analysis.

**Project Overview**
This project analyzes restaurant data to provide insights for decision-making. The analysis is structured in three levels:
Descriptive Analysis

Advanced Descriptive Analysis

Prescriptive Analysis
